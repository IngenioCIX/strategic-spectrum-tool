## Overview

This tool operationalizes a strategic framework developed to help agencies navigate the critical question: **Should we innovate boldly or refine what's working?**

During "in-between" economic periods (pre-recession, post-recession, or periods of uncertainty), fear-based decision-making often paralyzes both agencies and clients. This assessment provides a structured approach to strategic positioning through 8 key gauges.

## Features
